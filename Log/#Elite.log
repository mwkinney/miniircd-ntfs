[2012-09-07 01:59:22 UTC] <Mark_K> ah ya
[2012-09-07 01:59:23 UTC] <Ryan_S> so i had to explicitly disable it for this
[2012-09-07 01:59:27 UTC] <Mark_K> that makes sense
[2012-09-07 01:59:39 UTC] <Mark_K> if you reenable it and need it for some reason it might pass thru with h1-chqaws11.tlr.thomson.com
[2012-09-07 02:00:18 UTC] <Mark_K> prob good idea to use that anyway just to not leave anything up to question for someones pc

[2012-09-07 20:20:58 UTC] <Mark_K> pidgin has its own way of handling things.. and im sure they are emulating standard IRC chat behavior

[2012-09-07 21:49:46 UTC] <Mark_K> pick Message Notification, there's an option in there to enable notifications for Chat windows.. check that
[2012-09-07 21:49:55 UTC] <Mark_K> i selected Flash window too.. whatever that is
[2012-09-07 21:50:27 UTC] <Mark_K> i enabled Release Notification plugin as well, and Transparency (has a stay-on-top option which is very nice)

[2012-09-10 16:10:40 UTC] <Mark_K> You can enable Flash window below if you wish or whatever options
[2012-09-10 16:10:40 UTC] <Mark_K> Other good plugins are Release notification and Transparency, which has an option for Stay On Top for your buddy list or chat window

[2012-09-12 19:20:12 UTC] <randycantrell> did you get a stack trace this time?
[2012-09-12 19:20:21 UTC] <Mark_K> i emailed it
[2012-09-12 19:20:25 UTC] <Mark_K> easier to read than here
[2012-09-12 20:11:42 UTC] <randycantrell> ok - can you grab the 4 files one mor time?

[2012-09-12 20:15:08 UTC] <Mark_K> i shouldve shot it to >output.txt tho
[2012-09-12 20:18:21 UTC] <randycantrell> has it finished running?
[2012-09-12 20:18:55 UTC] <Mark_K> it did, just emailed you the end of the results
[2012-09-12 20:25:25 UTC] <randycantrell> ok - the bulk sync is working, but  there is still an issue with the individual sync
[2012-09-12 20:25:35 UTC] <randycantrell> i'm looking into it now
[2012-09-12 20:56:51 UTC] <randycantrell> can you confirm that the marketing center web.config has the new username/password?
[2012-09-12 20:57:09 UTC] <randycantrell> loader/Hubbard2
[2012-09-12 21:00:42 UTC] <Mark_K> sure
[2012-09-12 21:02:55 UTC] <Mark_K> the loader config has that still
[2012-09-12 21:03:12 UTC] <Mark_K> no reference to it in the MC site webconfig though
[2012-09-12 21:04:32 UTC] <randycantrell> can you add that to the MC site webconfig -- you can just copy it straight from the loader config in ther
[2012-09-12 21:04:37 UTC] <randycantrell> *there
[2012-09-12 21:04:48 UTC] <Mark_K> i just sent the appsettings node to you 
[2012-09-12 21:04:53 UTC] <Mark_K> let me know if you dont want all of that added.
[2012-09-12 21:04:59 UTC] <Mark_K> adding it now tho
[2012-09-12 21:05:35 UTC] <Mark_K> looks like only EM to RE sync is missing, rest is identical.
[2012-09-12 21:06:28 UTC] <Mark_K> done. rerun?
[2012-09-12 21:06:50 UTC] <randycantrell> no - that is for the individual sync
[2012-09-12 21:07:00 UTC] <randycantrell> the bulk sync is good
[2012-09-12 21:07:04 UTC] <randycantrell> thanks
[2012-09-12 21:10:35 UTC] <randycantrell> so that is now in the staged web config - right?

[2012-09-12 21:25:47 UTC] <randycantrell> hitting the url
[2012-09-12 21:25:51 UTC] <Mark_K> its ok now
[2012-09-12 21:25:59 UTC] <Mark_K> it was just a glitch from the app pool recycle
[2012-09-12 21:26:11 UTC] <Mark_K> happens on 1st visit after cycle

[2012-09-14 17:09:03 UTC] <Mark_K> anyone seen HTTP Error 502.3 - Bad Gateway on a reverse proxy setup?
[2012-09-14 17:09:22 UTC] <Mark_K> no one at 1north or here has setup reverse proxy before, uncharted territory
[2012-09-14 17:09:44 UTC] <Mark_K> google is my friend, but all suggestions thus far havent solved it
[2012-09-14 17:56:16 UTC] <Ryan_S> i've set it up before
[2012-09-14 17:56:22 UTC] <Ryan_S> not sure about that particular error
[2012-09-14 18:09:35 UTC] <Mark_K> as big of a question as why its not working is why they want to go from contact.nabarro.com -> contactmgr67a
[2012-09-14 18:09:44 UTC] <Mark_K> just use contact.nabarro.com internal+external
[2012-09-14 18:10:09 UTC] <Mark_K> ill be sure to raise that question
[2012-09-14 18:10:39 UTC] <Mark_K> its not live so cant be an issue with existing employees bookmarking contactmgr67a, doesnt seem desirable to me 
[2012-09-14 19:57:55 UTC] <Mark_K> well ive made progress on the reverse proxy issue, i think we're almost there
[2012-09-14 19:59:18 UTC] <Mark_K> kicks over to a windows auth error now, which makes sense coming over the web https://contact.nabarro.com
[2012-09-14 20:00:02 UTC] <Mark_K> rather than a 503 0x80072efd error
[2012-09-14 20:07:56 UTC] <Mark_K> if you're there ryan-
[2012-09-14 20:08:08 UTC] <Mark_K> i went thru some reverse proxy setup instructions i found
[2012-09-14 20:08:14 UTC] <Mark_K> and they didnt have anything in the URL rewrite
[2012-09-14 20:08:20 UTC] <Mark_K> so i set this and it would work but they have winauth
[2012-09-14 20:08:38 UTC] <Mark_K> so i set it to the internal url/login.aspx to bypass
[2012-09-14 20:08:45 UTC] <Mark_K> but i think its getting caught in the 404 redirect
[2012-09-14 20:08:52 UTC] <Mark_K> https://contact.nabarro.com
[2012-09-14 20:09:02 UTC] <Mark_K> pops up with commonpages/testforcookies.aspx ???
[2012-09-14 20:10:33 UTC] <Mark_K> while im talking to myself here- note how Gtalk just went down/up. IRC stays strong on QA11.

[2012-09-18 17:57:04 UTC] <Mark_K> a01t hosts sites though, so if it would fill up its a big deal, so we try to cleanup after ourselves there

[2012-09-21 17:44:09 UTC] <Mark_K> with no group chat its still no IRC replacement!
[2012-09-21 17:44:53 UTC] <Mark_K> and it can be used with pidgin :)
[2012-09-21 17:45:01 UTC] <Mark_K> its just a basic XMPP chat like gtalk
[2012-09-21 17:45:08 UTC] <Mark_K> so that means group chat is an extension if it has it
[2012-09-21 17:49:30 UTC] <Stacy_H> oic

[2012-09-21 17:50:30 UTC] <Mark_K> ya just nice if you want everything in 1 spot
[2012-09-21 17:50:38 UTC] <Mark_K> i have about 4 IM clients for work
[2012-09-21 17:50:50 UTC] <Mark_K> ive started to rebel
[2012-09-21 17:50:56 UTC] <Mark_K> and only login to IRC
[2012-09-21 17:51:18 UTC] <Stacy_H> you can paste screenshots and just share your screen
[2012-09-21 17:51:40 UTC] <Mark_K> ya thats what they have upstairs with microsoft lync
[2012-09-21 17:51:42 UTC] <Mark_K> does the same
[2012-09-21 17:51:45 UTC] <Mark_K> but MS lync sucks
[2012-09-21 17:51:49 UTC] <Mark_K> and doenst work well with outside clients
[2012-09-21 17:51:52 UTC] <Stacy_H> oo
[2012-09-21 17:52:08 UTC] <Mark_K> i have an account because rick wants to abuse his power and try to use me as free labor for 1N
[2012-09-21 17:52:22 UTC] <Mark_K> webex is the way to go, TR has the right idea with this thing
[2012-09-21 17:52:37 UTC] <Stacy_H> uhm
[2012-09-21 17:52:43 UTC] <Stacy_H> no, you are ours
[2012-09-21 17:53:07 UTC] <Mark_K> not according to rick and others upstairs who want to use me as long as possible :P
[2012-09-21 18:08:25 UTC] <Stacy_H> i guess till oct whatever right?
[2012-09-21 18:08:42 UTC] <Mark_K> false
[2012-09-21 18:08:48 UTC] <Mark_K> since we have shared hosting environment
[2012-09-21 18:09:01 UTC] <Mark_K> theyre going to hold onto me for pager duty till they totally split off
[2012-09-21 18:09:13 UTC] <Mark_K> i have a plan to end it earlier tho if all goes well but i havent had time to work ont he project
[2012-09-21 18:09:14 UTC] <Stacy_H> ugh
[2012-09-21 18:09:19 UTC] <Mark_K> yeah
[2012-09-21 18:10:31 UTC] <Mark_K> im on webex connect now
[2012-09-21 18:10:34 UTC] <Mark_K> seems ok
[2012-09-21 18:10:42 UTC] <Mark_K> im going to try to hook it up in pidgin tho
[2012-09-21 18:10:48 UTC] <Mark_K> so i dont always have to login to the official
[2012-09-21 18:11:19 UTC] <Mark_K> damn it has group chat!! noessss
[2012-09-21 18:11:34 UTC] <Mark_K> it looks dece tho
[2012-09-21 18:18:37 UTC] <Mark_K> it doesnt have persistent group chat like IRC 
[2012-09-21 18:18:44 UTC] <Mark_K> so you have to initiate a new group chat everytime youw ant to
[2012-09-21 18:18:52 UTC] <Mark_K> cant have it join #elite or something automatically
[2012-09-21 18:21:15 UTC] <Stacy_H> oh thats not bad
[2012-09-21 18:21:33 UTC] <Mark_K> no but it is nice, if people used it, to automatically be in this channel everyday
[2012-09-21 18:21:41 UTC] <Mark_K> vs having to start one
[2012-09-21 18:21:52 UTC] <Stacy_H> right
[2012-09-21 18:22:06 UTC] <Stacy_H> well somedays I have to close it bc I find it constantly blinking but not for me...
[2012-09-21 18:22:18 UTC] <Mark_K> heh
[2012-09-21 18:22:19 UTC] <Mark_K> ya
[2012-09-21 18:22:29 UTC] <Mark_K> thats when you create a room for just your group
[2012-09-21 18:22:34 UTC] <Mark_K> but here thers not enough people for that
[2012-09-21 18:22:46 UTC] <Stacy_H> right but others have to as well
[2012-09-21 18:22:46 UTC] <Mark_K> best to limit idle chatter cuz of that
[2012-09-21 18:23:01 UTC] <Mark_K> can disable alerts too
[2012-09-21 18:23:06 UTC] <Stacy_H> true!
[2012-09-21 18:23:22 UTC] <Mark_K> then shoot the person whose attention you need a direct message
[2012-09-21 18:23:29 UTC] <Stacy_H> right

[2012-09-26 19:45:31 UTC] <Mark_K> ya
[2012-09-26 19:45:38 UTC] <ron> sweet, what was the problem?
[2012-09-26 19:45:43 UTC] <ron> (in a nutshell)
[2012-09-26 19:46:16 UTC] <Mark_K> efrust user account which we use to login had the pw changed by the client. this user was running the Word system service and used for Word file DCOM permissions settings
[2012-09-26 19:46:26 UTC] <ron> oh oops
[2012-09-26 19:46:33 UTC] <Mark_K> updating those passwords and restarting the wordservice fixed it

[2012-09-27 14:46:17 UTC] <Padmini> so the loader is using the right loader user account and run?
[2012-09-27 14:46:25 UTC] <Padmini> what was the issue?
[2012-09-27 15:04:50 UTC] <Mark_K> curses, it does still have my credentials. no matter though, i think the issue was one of two things. that the sftp transfer was being done in a cmd file rather than a batch or
[2012-09-27 15:04:57 UTC] <Mark_K> removing the working path in the scheduled task 
[2012-09-27 15:05:19 UTC] <Padmini> ic...
[2012-09-27 15:06:36 UTC] <Padmini> so would we be running the loader again tonight after changing the user to check if scheduled task runs fine?
[2012-09-27 15:06:47 UTC] <Padmini> hopefully that will be the last test we need to do
[2012-09-27 15:06:58 UTC] <Mark_K> ill run it today

[2012-10-04 18:25:07 UTC] <ron> hey Mr. Kinney
[2012-10-04 18:26:04 UTC] <ron> Farhan is asking if the clients need to do something on their end as part of the resolution to the DNS issue from this morning
[2012-10-04 18:34:18 UTC] <ron> nm, i got info from Dinh
[2012-10-04 18:52:05 UTC] <Mark_K> not really
[2012-10-04 18:52:08 UTC] <Mark_K> what did dinh say?
[2012-10-04 18:52:20 UTC] <Mark_K> to my knowledge theres nothing they should do or can do
[2012-10-04 18:52:28 UTC] <Mark_K> the clients that have made changes, have actually made it worse
[2012-10-04 18:52:32 UTC] <Mark_K> i'd prob suggest to hold tight.
[2012-10-04 18:52:32 UTC] <ron> i guess they're having some clients update their DNS
[2012-10-04 18:52:33 UTC] <ron> oh
[2012-10-04 18:52:37 UTC] <ron> heh
[2012-10-04 20:17:29 UTC] <Mark_K> yeah 
[2012-10-04 20:17:36 UTC] <Mark_K> some instructions went out, a lot of confusion
[2012-10-04 20:17:39 UTC] <Mark_K> a lot of dropping the ball
[2012-10-04 20:17:44 UTC] <ron> oops
[2012-10-04 20:17:47 UTC] <Mark_K> ive followed up for us on the 14 MC-only clients
[2012-10-04 20:17:54 UTC] <ron> ok
[2012-10-04 20:17:55 UTC] <Mark_K> the higher ups are distributing hte message
[2012-10-04 20:18:02 UTC] <ron> gotcha
[2012-10-04 20:18:19 UTC] <Mark_K> i ordered my samsung galaxy s3 last night

[2012-10-16 19:23:42 UTC] <Stacy_H> hey Mark
[2012-10-16 19:23:51 UTC] <Stacy_H> since I'm so awesome and logged into chat...
[2012-10-16 19:24:31 UTC] <Stacy_H> Can you please DELETE FROM tbl_CachedWordContent for AGG live... marketingcm.agg.com
[2012-10-16 19:53:16 UTC] <Mark_K> of course
[2012-10-16 19:53:33 UTC] <Mark_K> yeah my chatroom service has failed but im not going to logoff
[2012-10-16 19:54:02 UTC] <Mark_K> i still think its better to use things like this or gchat than the stuff like webex connect
[2012-10-16 19:54:19 UTC] <Mark_K> cuz those are proprietary, if they stop developing it, you have no more chat :(
[2012-10-16 19:54:19 UTC] <Stacy_H> lol
[2012-10-16 19:54:36 UTC] <Stacy_H> right
[2012-10-16 19:54:46 UTC] <Mark_K> and you're stuck on their client while it is functioning. gtalk and irc you can use whatever you want
[2012-10-16 19:55:00 UTC] <Mark_K> that said, it is one of the better products ive used for chat at work.
[2012-10-16 19:55:09 UTC] <Mark_K> i like the webex integration, gives it a purpose in life.
[2012-10-16 19:55:18 UTC] <Stacy_H> yea i like that it uses your cal for status's 
[2012-10-16 19:56:02 UTC] <Mark_K> you could get that thru some plugin with some chat client for gtalk. and im sure with irc but its not very user friendly in comparison
[2012-10-16 19:56:21 UTC] <Stacy_H> right
[2012-10-16 19:56:32 UTC] <Stacy_H> well and none of my iphone apps let me see you guys now
[2012-10-16 19:56:42 UTC] <Stacy_H> so when i went to the docs yesterday I culdnt IM Katy
[2012-10-16 19:56:45 UTC] <Mark_K> on webex connect?
[2012-10-16 19:56:51 UTC] <Mark_K> yup. there you go.
[2012-10-16 19:57:03 UTC] <Mark_K> also i couldnt connect to it VPN'd from home either
[2012-10-16 19:57:05 UTC] <Mark_K> the other week
[2012-10-16 19:57:09 UTC] <Stacy_H> oh rly?
[2012-10-16 19:57:12 UTC] <Mark_K> nope
[2012-10-16 19:57:20 UTC] <Mark_K> not a cool feature. and i had the proxy setup..
[2012-10-16 19:57:27 UTC] <Stacy_H> well I have some people gmail and work on the new client
[2012-10-16 19:57:40 UTC] <Stacy_H> so if say Joko works from home and uses gchat... we'd be good
[2012-10-16 19:57:47 UTC] <Stacy_H> but he would still have to have both clients installed
[2012-10-16 19:57:55 UTC] <Stacy_H> no good
[2012-10-16 19:58:36 UTC] <Mark_K> yeah i was hoping we'd use gtalk and irc. maybe over time webex connect will die if it does what you said on the phone and no one can connect outside of the office
[2012-10-16 19:58:49 UTC] <Mark_K> doesnt really matter but i never had an issue with gtalk
[2012-10-16 19:58:55 UTC] <Mark_K> outside of sad or no group chat
[2012-10-16 19:59:06 UTC] <Mark_K> i'll be waiting in the wings on #elite ;)
[2012-10-16 19:59:21 UTC] <Mark_K> i do have a casino bot to setup on the server.
[2012-10-16 19:59:26 UTC] <Stacy_H> lol I'll stand strong with you
[2012-10-16 19:59:34 UTC] <Mark_K> we can play 8 casino games, tracks our $$$ and is multiplayer
[2012-10-16 19:59:36 UTC] <Mark_K> blackjack ect.

[2012-10-23 20:31:41 UTC] <mdkill> stacy and i need to apply an update to agg mc and wc
[2012-10-23 20:49:12 UTC] <Mark_K> i can always disable alerts outside of the 5-6 window 
[2012-10-23 20:49:24 UTC] <Mark_K> let me see if mcguire has a logfile yet
[2012-10-23 20:50:52 UTC] <Mark_K> no logfile
[2012-10-23 20:51:14 UTC] <Mark_K> mdkill: kill it?
[2012-10-23 20:52:02 UTC] <Mark_K> let me know, i can start it by commandline and can watch it instead.
[2012-10-23 20:58:39 UTC] <Stacy_H> mdkill: Sitescope will be disabled and I got the clients ok
[2012-10-23 21:58:44 UTC] <mdkill> ok
[2012-10-23 21:59:06 UTC] <mdkill> stacy - this is the task for the update we will perform on agg: http://jira.hubbardone.com/browse/DST-8754
[2012-10-23 21:59:23 UTC] <mdkill> mark - please run the mcguire exe by command line
[2012-10-23 22:00:26 UTC] <Mark_K> running now
[2012-10-23 22:10:13 UTC] <Mark_K> mcguires xml loader must not output anything till it's done?
[2012-10-23 22:10:19 UTC] <Mark_K> right now the output.txt is blank.
[2012-10-23 22:10:26 UTC] <Mark_K> or still blank
[2012-10-23 22:18:35 UTC] <mdkill> did you set it as attended?
[2012-10-23 22:20:31 UTC] <Stacy_H> mdkill: do I need to do anything for that AGG update?
[2012-10-23 22:35:24 UTC] <mdkill> stacy - i never got an update from mark that it has been completed
[2012-10-23 22:35:33 UTC] <mdkill> and it doesn't look like the task was updated either
[2012-10-23 22:37:32 UTC] <Stacy_H> Mark_K: If you still can do this we just need to make sure alerts are still disabled.
[2012-10-23 22:37:50 UTC] <Mark_K> no worries
[2012-10-23 22:38:19 UTC] <Stacy_H> thanks
